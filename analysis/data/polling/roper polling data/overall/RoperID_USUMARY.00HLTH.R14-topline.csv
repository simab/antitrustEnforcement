USUMARY.00HLTH.R14,Statement A,71,"Another issue that is currently being discussed is the rising cost of prescription drugs. Here are two arguments about whether the government should limit how much drug companies can charge for drugs for which they have an exclusive patent. Tell me which one comes closer to your view. A. Because drug companies have a monopoly on some drugs they develop, they are not limited by competition and can charge very high prices. If drug companies are making excessive profits on these drugs, the government should step in and regulate the price, just like they regulate monopolies like gas and electric companies. B. Though prices for drugs may seem high, drug companies have to spend a great deal of research money to discover new drugs. The government should not limit how much drug companies can charge, because this will discourage them from doing important research on life-saving drugs.",pro,* = less than .5 percent,,8/30/00,"Center for the Study of Policy Attitudes, University of Maryland",,Americans on Health Care Policy Survey,6/23/00,7/9/00,Y,National adult,652,Telephone Interview,
